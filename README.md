# KNOW-B4-U-GO
Have you ever stayed at an Airbnb? <br>
Did research on where you're staying before booking? <br> 
Had to click through multiple different sites to find all the answers you were looking for?

Thatâ€™s where Know-B4-U-Go comes in! Filling a whitespace in the market where you can go to one site and gain a holistic perspective of where you want to travel (Airbnb pricing by neighborhood, crime data, comments sentiment analysis, & where to eat).

Take a look at the beta-site here: <br>
